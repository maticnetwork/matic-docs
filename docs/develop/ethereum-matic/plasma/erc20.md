### High Level Flow

#### **Deposit ERC20 (2 step process)**

1. The tokens need to be first approved to the Matic rootchain contract on Parent Chain (Ethereum/Goerli).
2. Once approved, the **deposit** function is to be invoked where the tokens get deposited to the Matic contract, and are available for use in the Matic network.

#### **Transfer ERC20**

Once you have funds on Matic, you can use those funds to send to others instantly.

#### **Withdraw ERC20 (3 step process)**

1. Withdrawal of funds is initiated from Matic Network. A checkpoint interval of 30 mins(For testnets wait for ~10 minutes) is set, where all the blocks on the Matic block layer are validated since the last checkpoint.
2. Once the checkpoint is submitted to the mainchain ERC20 contract, an NFT Exit (ERC721) token is created of equivalent value. Users need to wait for a 7 day challenge period (For testnets wait for ~5 minutes for)
3. Once the challenge period is complete, the withdrawn funds can be claimed back to your ERC20 acccount from the mainchain contract using a process-exit procedure.

> For now, just go with the fact that the challenge period for withdrawals is an important part of the Plasma framework to ensure security of your transactions. Later, once you get to know the system better, the reason for the 7-day withdrawal window will become clear to you.

## Setup Details

---

### Configuring Matic SDK

Install Matic SDK (**_2.0.2)_**

```bash
npm install --save @maticnetwork/maticjs
```

### util.js

Initiating Maticjs client

```js
const bn = require("bn.js");
const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");

const Network = require("@maticnetwork/meta/network");
const Matic = require("@maticnetwork/maticjs").default;

const SCALING_FACTOR = new bn(10).pow(new bn(18));

async function getMaticClient(_network = "testnet", _version = "mumbai") {
  const network = new Network(_network, _version);
  const { from } = getAccount();
  const matic = new Matic({
    network: _network,
    version: _version,
    parentProvider: new HDWalletProvider(
      process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
      network.Main.RPC
    ),
    maticProvider: new HDWalletProvider(
      process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
      network.Matic.RPC
    ),
    parentDefaultOptions: { from },
    maticDefaultOptions: { from },
  });
  await matic.initialize();
  return { matic, network };
}

function getAccount() {
  if (!process.env.PRIVATE_KEY || !process.env.FROM) {
    throw new Error("Please set the PRIVATE_KEY/FROM env vars");
  }
  return { privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, from: process.env.FROM };
}

module.exports = {
  SCALING_FACTOR,
  getMaticClient,
  getAccount,
};
```

### process.env

Create a new file in root directory name it process.env

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY = ""
FROM = ""
```

## deposit.js

**Approve**: This is a normal ERC20 approval so that **_depositManagerContract_** can call **_transferFrom_** function. Matic Plasma client exposes **_approveERC20TokensForDeposit_** method to make this call.

**deposit**: Deposit can be done by calling **_depositERC20ForUser_** on depositManagerContract contract.

> Note that token needs to be mapped and approved for transfer beforehand.

**_depositERC20ForUser_** method to make this call.

```js
const utils = require('./utils')

async function execute() {
  const { matic, network } = await utils.getMaticClient()
  const { from } = utils.getAccount()

  const token = network.Main.Contracts.Tokens.TestToken
  const amount = matic.web3Client.web3.utils.toWei('1.567')

  // approve
  await matic.approveERC20TokensForDeposit(token, amount).then((res) => {
        console.log("approve hash: ", res.transactionHash)
  })

  // deposit
  await matic.depositERC20ForUser(token, from, amount)).then((res) => {
        console.log("deposit hash: ", res.transactionHash)
  })
}
execute().then(_ => process.exit(0))
```

> NOTE: Deposits from Ethereum to Matic happen using a state sync mechanism and takes about ~5-7 minutes. After waiting for this time interval, it is recommended to check the balance using web3.js/matic.js library or using Metamask. The explorer will show the balance only if at least one asset transfer has happened on the child chain. This [link](/docs/develop/ethereum-matic/plasma/deposit-withdraw-event-plasma) explains how to track the deposit events.

## transfer.js

> `recipient` is the receiverâ€™s address, to whom the funds are supposed to be sent.

```js
const utils = require("./utils");

async function execute() {
  const { matic, network } = await utils.getMaticClient();
  const { from } = utils.getAccount();

  const recipient = "<>";

  const childTokenAddress = network.Matic.Contracts.Tokens.TestToken;
  const amount = matic.web3Client.web3.utils.toWei("1.23");

  await matic
    .transferERC20Tokens(childTokenAddress, recipient, amount, {
      from,
      parent: false,
    })
    .then((res) => {
      console.log("Transfer hash: ", res.transactionHash);
    });
}

execute().then((_) => process.exit(0));
```

## Withdraw

### 1. Burn

User can call **_withdraw_** function of **_getERC20TokenContract_** child token contract. This function should burn the tokens. Matic Plasma client exposes **_startWithdraw_** method to make this call.

```js
const utils = require("./utils");

async function execute() {
  const { matic, network } = await utils.getMaticClient();
  const { from } = utils.getAccount();

  const token = network.Matic.Contracts.Tokens.TestToken;
  const amount = matic.web3Client.web3.utils.toWei("5.678");

  await matic.startWithdraw(token, amount, { from }).then((res) => {
    console.log("Burn hash: ", res.transactionHash);
  });
}

execute().then((_) => process.exit(0));
```

### 2. confirm-withdraw.js

User can call **_startExitWithBurntTokens_** function of **_erc20Predicate_** contract. This function should burn the tokens. Matic Plasma client exposes **_withdraw_** method to make this call. This function can be called only after the checkpoint is included in the main chain. The checkpoint inclusion can be tracked by following this [guide](/docs/develop/ethereum-matic/plasma/deposit-withdraw-event-plasma#checkpoint-events).

```js
//Wait for ~10 mins for Mumbai testnet or ~30mins for Ethereum Mainnet till the checkpoint is submitted for burned transaction, then run the confirm withdraw
const utils = require("./utils");

async function execute() {
  const { matic } = await utils.getMaticClient();
  const { from } = utils.getAccount();

  // Submit proof of burn on Main Chain
  const txHash = "<>";
  await matic.withdraw(txHash, { from, gas: "7000000" }).then((res) => {
    console.log("Confirm withdraw hash: ", res.transactionHash);
  });
}
// Withdraw process is completed, funds will be transfered to your account after challege period is over.
execute().then((_) => process.exit(0));
```

### 3. Process Exit

Once the **_Challenge Period_** has been passed for the transaction present in checkpoint, user should call the **_processExits_** function of **_withdrawManager_** contract and submit the proof of burn. Upon submitting valid proof tokens are transferred to the user. Matic Plasma client exposes **_processExits_** method to make this call.

```js
const utils = require("./utils");

async function execute() {
  const { matic, network } = await utils.getMaticClient();
  const { from } = utils.getAccount();

  const token = network.Main.Contracts.Tokens.TestToken;
  await matic.processExits(token, { from, gas: 7000000 }).then((res) => {
    console.log("Exit hash: ", res.transactionHash);
  });
}

execute().then((_) => process.exit(0));
```

_Note: A checkpoint, which is a representation of all transactions happening on the Matic Network to the ERC20 chain every ~30 minutes, is submitted to the mainchain ERC20 contract._

_Note: Once the checkpoint is submitted, user needs to wait for a challenge period of 7 days long._
