### Wallets

* [**Arkane**](https://arkane.network/): Arkane is a user-friendly, secure, and custodial key management system for DApps. Arkane supports both Web and mobile, and can service both crypto savvy users as well as a more mainstream audience. Being blockchain agnostic they are a great fit for supporting both Matic and Ethereum. [For more...](arkane/intro)

* [**Fortmatic**](https://fortmatic.com/): Fortmatic SDK allows you to easily integrate your app with the Ethereum blockchain, whether you already have a dApp integrated with web3 or are starting from scratch. Fortmatic provides a smooth and delightful experience for both you and your app's users. [For more...](fortmatic)

* [**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/): Metamask is a browser add-on that manages a user’s Ethereum wallet by storing their private key on their browser’s data store and the seed phrase encrypted with their password. It is a non-custodial wallet, meaning, the user has full access and responsibility their private key. Once lost, the user can no longer control the savings or restore access to the wallet. [For more...](metamask)

* [**Portis**](https://www.portis.io/): Portis is a web-based wallet built keeping easy user-onboarding in mind. It comes with a javascript SDK that integrates into the DApp and creates a local wallet-less experience for the user. Further, it handles setting up the wallet, transactions and gas fees. [For more...](portis)

* [**Torus**](https://toruswallet.io/): Torus is a user-friendly, secure, and non-custodial key management system for DApps. We're focused on providing mainstream users a gateway to the decentralized ecosystem. [For more...](torus)

* [**Wallet Connect**](https://walletconnect.org/): WalletConnect is an open protocol to communicate securely between Wallets and Dapps (Web3 Apps). The protocol establishes a remote connection between two apps and/or devices using a Bridge server to relay payloads. These payloads are symmetrically encrypted through a shared key between the two peers. [For more...](walletconnect)


### High-level steps:

The overall steps would essentially remain the same for any client side application to talk to the blockchain:
 
1. **Set up Web3**: [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) is a javascript library that allows our client-side application to talk to the blockchain. We configure web3 to communicate via Metamask/Wallet Connect/Portis. 
> Note: Refer [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.2/getting-started.html#adding-web3-js) docs to 
add web3 to your project 
2. **Set up Account**: To send transactions from (specifically for transactions that alter the state of the blockchain) 
3. **Instantiate contracts**: Once we have our web3 object in place, we next instantiate our deployed contract, with which we interact. 
4. **Call functions**: we fetch data via functions in the contract - through our contract object.
